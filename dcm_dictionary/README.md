# dcm-dictionary

A Rust crate providing a comprehensive DICOM data dictionary for tag lookups. This dictionary contains standard DICOM
tags with their corresponding Value Representations (VR), names, Value Multiplicities (VM), and version information.

## Generation

The dictionary content is automatically generated by the `rad-tools-dcm-dictionary-builder` crate. The builder downloads
the latest DICOM tag definitions from the DCMTK repository and generates Rust code with a static dictionary
implementation.
